 * ENS resolution (same `{ address, resolverError, resolving }` shape, wired into `AddressInput`
 * the same way). Unlike Tron's base58 conversion, this can't be done synchronously/offline: an
 * account's EVM alias isn't derivable from its id alone, so it needs the same async-resolve →
 * feed-into-form-value pattern ENS already uses.
